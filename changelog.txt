Lucid is an evolving voice assistant to assist people in
their work. If I could get enough votes, I could re-code it
for peoplE who have a main focus such as drawing or coding.
The main version is just for people who want a voice assistant.

First functional version of lucid up and running.

Added an error function, so if the user's system is buggy,
instead of crashing, it reports an error code so you could
translate the code through Lucid. -Avid
